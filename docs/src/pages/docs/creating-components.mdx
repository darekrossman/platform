# Creating Components

<Text variant="subhead1">
  From a small set of simple primitives, we can build more complex, composite
  components while easily maintaining a consistent look & feel across our app.
</Text>

## Building primitives

Every component, whether its a simple text component or a full-featured modal, can be broken down into a set of simpler, primitive components. Let's try it.

### Breaking down a modal

Looking at what a standard modal actually does, we can see that its really just an element that can be shown or hidden in response to some events. It typically sits above the current page content, using absolute or fixed positioning. There might also be a semi-transparent overlay behind the modal element itself to dim the content in the background.

#### What are the minimum elements needed to build a basic modal?

- _container_: `<div>` element
- _background overlay_: `<div>` element
- _content container_: `<div>` element

<Callout level="info" mt={4}>
  <Text variant="h4">Keeping it simple</Text>
  <Text>
    Let's set aside the fancy stuff like transitions and portals for now. We'll
    come back to those concepts later.

</Callout>

### A basic modal

```jsx noInline
const Modal = ({ isOpen, children }) =>
  isOpen && (
    <Flex variant="cover" position="fixed">
      <Box
        variant="cover"
        position="fixed"
        bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)"
        zIndex={1}
      />
      <Box position="relative" width={475} m="auto" zIndex={2}>
        {children}
      </Box>
    </Flex>
  )

render(() => {
  const [isOpen, setOpenState] = React.useState(false)

  const toggleModal = () => setOpenState(!isOpen)

  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={toggleModal}>Open Modal</Button>

      <Modal isOpen={isOpen}>
        <Box p={3} bg="white">
          <Text variant="h3">Simple</Text>
          <Text>
            With a few simple primitives, we've got a functioning Modal!
          </Text>
          <Button mt={3} onClick={toggleModal}>
            Close
          </Button>
        </Box>
      </Modal>
    </div>
  )
})
```

### A closer look

By making use of our ESS UI primitives, we can rapidly build more complex components, taking advantage of both the familiar props API and simple theme variants.
