# Image

## Basic Example

```jsx
<Image
  src="https://picsum.photos/680/300/?random"
  width={680}
  height={300}
  fluid
/>
```

## Loading Transition

Images automatically fade in when they are loaded and ready to be displayed. The fade transition is controlled by [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io), which helps make the transition smooth even as the image's `src` is changing.

You can pass your own config to `react-spring` via the `springConfig` prop. It takes a function that passes the ready state of the image, along with the default config. The return value is shallow merged with the default spring config.

```jsx noInline
render(() => {
  const [time, setTime] = React.useState(Date.now())
  return (
    <div>
      <Image
        src={`https://picsum.photos/300/?random=${time}`}
        width={300}
        height={300}
        springConfig={ready => ({ transform: `scale(${ready ? 1 : 0.9})` })}
      />
      <Button mt={3} onClick={() => setTime(Date.now())}>
        Load New Image
      </Button>
    </div>
  )
})
```
